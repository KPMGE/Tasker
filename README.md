# Tasker

## Goal 
This is a simple, but pretty, React Native application. My goal here was create a simple
task manager application, so that i could get organized easier. 

## Tools
In this project i have learned a lot. This is because i have chosen a lot of powerful technologies. 

The first one was Typescript, i have used it in both, the frontend and the backend of this application. 
My reason for that choice was that, i love javascript, but sometimes when using it, specially for big projects, 
it can become a little bit unpredictable, because we have no types in it. In that context, Typescript makes javascript
even better. Because with it, we can create our own types, define our own rules and so much more features. This makes 
the building process faster and less error prone. 

For the backend, in addition to Typescript, i have chosen NodeJs, Express and MongoDB. I like that stack, 
because with it we can create good backend services as i did. More than that, i have run this entire backend server 
with Docker. And it was a great experience for me as well.

For the frontend i have used the React Native framework because i have been working with a lot of web technologies so far,
just like html, css and javascript. I've worked with some frameworks as well, just like React and NextJs. 
In that context, i thought that it was a good idea learning a new framework to create mobile applications.


## Results
Now, it's time to see something working, hopefully.

#### Home Screen
Here, we have a git showing the final result on the Home Screen. All the information about that tasks is being 
recovered from the NodeJs server.

#### Add Task Screen
Here, we have the opportunity to create a new task.

<hr>

Now that we have added a task, it will appear on the Home Screen. All this information will be available even 
if the user closes the application, because our backend is storing our information in a DataBase, the MongoDB DataBase in our case.
